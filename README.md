# Kubernetes Container Communication 

## Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a Kubernetes-based infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform. The project focuses on enabling communication between two Docker containers running within the same Kubernetes pod.

## Technologies

- **Docker**: Containerization platform used for creating and managing Docker containers.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform used for managing and scaling containerized applications.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Cloud service provider where the infrastructure is deployed.

## Features

- Deployed a Kubernetes cluster on GCP.
- Utilized Terraform to automate the setup of Kubernetes and related infrastructure.
- Configured Kubernetes resources including pods, deployments, and services.
- Enabled seamless communication between two Docker containers running within the same pod.
